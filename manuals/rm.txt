NAME

rm - remove files or directories

SYNOPSIS
rm [-f] [-i] [-r|-R] [-d] [-v] file...

DESCRIPTION
The rm command removes each specified file. By default, it does not remove directories. However, when used with the -r or -R option, it will remove directories and their contents recursively.

OPTIONS

- -f
  - Force: Ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt. This option overrides -i.

- -i
  - Interactive: Prompt before every removal. The user must confirm each file or directory removal by typing 'y' or 'Y'.

- -r, -R
  - Recursive: Remove directories and their contents recursively. This option is necessary to remove non-empty directories.

- -d
  - Remove empty directories: Remove directories, even if they are empty. This option allows the removal of empty directories without using -r.

- -v
  - Verbose: Explain what is being done. The command will print the name of each file or directory it removes.

USAGE

To remove a file:
rm file.txt

To remove a file interactively:
rm -i file.txt

To forcefully remove a file without prompting:
rm -f file.txt

To remove a directory and its contents recursively:
rm -r directory_name

To remove an empty directory:
rm -d empty_directory

To remove files or directories with verbose output:
rm -v file.txt directory_name

NOTES

- If neither -r nor -d is specified, rm will not remove directories.
- The -f option suppresses error messages for nonexistent files and overrides the -i option.
- Use caution with the -r option, as it will delete all files and subdirectories within the specified directory.

EXIT STATUS

- Returns 0 if all specified files or directories were successfully removed.
- Returns a non-zero status if any file or directory could not be removed.
