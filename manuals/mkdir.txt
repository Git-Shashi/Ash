NAME
     mkdir – make directories

SYNOPSIS
     mkdir [-p] [-m mode] directory_name ...


DESCRIPTION
     The mkdir utility creates the directories named as operands, in the order specified, using mode “rwxrwxrwx”
     (0777) as modified by the current umask(2).

     If a directory is created without any option provided then the created directory will have (0755) as default                        
     permissions  As specified in the chmod command.

     The options are as follows:

     -m mode        Set the file permission bits of the final created directory to the specified mode.  The mode
                    argument can be in any of the formats specified to the chmod(1) command.  If a symbolic mode is
                    specified, the operation characters ‘+’ and ‘-’ are interpreted relative to an initial mode of
                    “a=rwx”.

     -p             Create intermediate directories as required.  If this option is not specified, the full path
                    prefix of each operand must already exist.  On the other hand, with this option specified, no
                    error will be reported if a directory given as an operand already exists.  Intermediate
                    directories are created with permission bits of “rwxrwxrwx” (0777) as modified by the current
                    umask, plus write and search permission for the owner.
