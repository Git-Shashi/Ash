## NAME
rmdir - remove empty directories

## SYNOPSIS

rmdir [-p] [-v] directory...

## DESCRIPTION
The rmdir program is a simplified version of the Unix rmdir command. It removes the specified directories, provided they are empty. It also offers options to remove parent directories and to provide verbose output.

## OPTIONS
- -p
  - Remove the specified directory and its parent directories if they become empty. This option allows for recursive removal of directories up the path hierarchy.
  
- -v
  - Enable verbose mode. The program will print a message each time a directory is successfully removed.

## USAGE
To use the rmdir program, simply run the command with the desired options and directories:

rmdir [-p] [-v] directory...

### EXAMPLES
- Remove a single directory:
  
  rmdir mydir
  
- Remove a directory and its parent directories if they become empty:
  
  rmdir -p mydir/subdir
  
- Remove a directory with verbose output:
  
  rmdir -v mydir
  
- Remove a directory and its parent directories with verbose output:
  
  rmdir -pv mydir/subdir

## NOTES
- The program only removes empty directories. If a directory contains files or other directories, it will not be removed.
- The program does not handle all edge cases and permissions as the actual rmdir command does. It is intended as a basic implementation for educational purposes.

## AUTHOR
This program was implemented as a simplified version of the rmdir command for demonstration purposes.
