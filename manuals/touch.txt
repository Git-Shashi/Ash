 NAME
touch - change file timestamps

## SYNOPSIS

touch [-a] [-c] filename

## DESCRIPTION
The **touch** utility updates the access and modification times of each specified file to the current time. By default, if the file does not exist, it is created with default permissions.

### OPTIONS
  -a 
  Change only the access time. The modification time remains unchanged.

  -c
  Do not create any files. If a specified file does not exist, no action is taken, and no error message is displayed.

  OPERANDS
- filename**  
  The name of the file for which the timestamps are to be updated. If the -c option is not specified and the file does not exist, it will be created.

## EXIT STATUS
-  0 
  Successful completion.

- **>0**  
  An error occurred.

## EXAMPLES
- Update both access and modification times of file.txt:
     
  touch file.txt
     

- Update only the access time of file.txt:
     
  touch -a file.txt
     

- Do not create file.txt if it does not exist:
     
  touch -c file.txt
     

## NOTES
- The program uses the utimensat system call to update the timestamps. If the -a option is specified, only the access time is updated; otherwise, both access and modification times are updated.
- The program uses the [open](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html) system call to create the file if it does not exist and the -c option is not specified.
